## My process
Firstly I think about how to create it by own using box model. Added some HTML code (box identification) and then done styling. Each element in this code is creating one box. So start from bigger box and then style small elements. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first challange. I had not done any of the project before this sololy. So this is some special. Thinking and creating a goal in mind and you are halfway there towards your goal. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
