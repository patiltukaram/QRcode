## Overview
This is a simple QR code project in which we have used HTML and CSS. Here's a small project to demonstrate how a responsive website should look, We have used media quries for responsiveness.

## My process
Firstly I think about how to create it by own using box model. Added some HTML code (box identification) and then done styling. Each element in this code is creating one box. So start from bigger box and then style small elements. Take referance and help from MDN docs. Also seen some previous videos from my course on udemy. Stuks mainly in the design of responsivenes, took help of google. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first challange. I had not done any of the project before this sololy. So this is some special. Think and create a goal in your mind and you are halfway there towards your goal. Now days for making website responsive we mainly use frameworks. Flexbox is used to design small webpages. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

@media (max-width:400px){
    body{
      min-height:100vh;
      display: grid;
      place-items: center;
   }
    main {
     width: 100%;
     padding: 1.2rem;
    }
  }




### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs]([https://www.example.com](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)) - This helped me for learning about behaviour of every HTML and CSS element . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand about responsive websites. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)) - This is an amazing article which helped me in learning about UI concepts. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
